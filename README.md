## Overview

  The Purpose of the challenge is to help Avy see when will be the best time to open up the surf shop based off the weather for the year. Avy has a surf shop and will be serving ice cream so opening during the right time and temperature of the year is crucial to having success opening day and onward.
  
  
## Results

   * We took analysis from 1-1-2010, to 8-23-2017. We the analydsis we see there is a 2 inch max rainfall difference between June and December
   * In June there is an average rainfall of .13 inches while in December there is a average of .22 inches.
   * In the 3rd Quartile we see where they become very close with June at .12 and December at .15

## Summary

   * With helping Avy decide when to open, the better choice is definitely June. With the temperatures alone more people are ready to get out during the summer becuase of the warmth. Many more people tend to take more vacations in the summer giving Avy a better opportunity for a grand opening. In the analysis it would help to know when the Rain is actually occuring, day or night? We also dont really know the severity of the rain, does it drizzle for a little and go away and the sun comes back out? or does it rain all day and keep everyone inside? But being we dont have this info, June to August would be Avy's best chance at a home run grand opening and establishing the business rapidly in the area.
